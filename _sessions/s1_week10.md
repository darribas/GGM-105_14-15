## Session on Week 8

#### Reading

* *"The Kind of a Problem a City Is"* by Luís Bettencourt ([pdf](http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/13-03-008.pdf)). Chapter in [*Die Stadt entschlüsseln*](http://www.degruyter.com/viewbooktoc/product/206812), edited by Dietmar Offenhuber and Carlo Ratti (2013).

Questions to discuss:

* How do you compare this view of cities with the other texts we have read so
  far?
* Relevance of urban planning over history (marked by technology)
* The Complex Systems approach to cities
