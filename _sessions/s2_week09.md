## Session on week 9 (Semester 2)

### Essays (15 min.)
* How were essays (haven’t read them but will over the course of next week)?
* Areas they struggled.
* Areas they enjoyed.

### Presentations (30 min.)
* Are they all thinking of speaking about the same topic?
* Check on how far they are:
	* Do they have an idea of the talk?
	* Have they come up with a structure?
	* Do they have the slides already?
	* Have they rehearsed at least once?
* Remember the main steps:
	* Think.
	* Prepare.
	* Talk.
* Presentations are 10 minutes + 5 extra for questions.
	* Make an effort to stick to it.
	* Think also of questions for colleagues, it’s good for them (feel supported) and for you (evaluated).

### General feedback of the course (15 min.)
Today is the last session, I’d like to get general sense of the course.
* What did you expect?
* What have you enjoyed most? least?
* What would you change?
* Any changes particularly considering what you’ve heard from friends with other tutors?
