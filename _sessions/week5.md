## Session on Week 5

#### Reading

*"The Search for the Future Inside Ourselves â€“ Life on the New Frontier"* ([html](http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm?action=chapters&id=2)). Chapter 1 in [*"Edge city: Life on the New Frontier"*](http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm?action=book&id=1), by Joel Garreau (1991).

Questions to discuss:

* How does the writing style compare with the previous texts we have read?
* How is the issue of the spatial structure of a city related to geography?
  And to economics?

#### Essay feedback

* Stylized facts
    - No "space" or "location" to define Geography, however some "scarcity" for economics
    - Some did attempt to define the disciplines before discussing differences
      and similarities
    - However, very few (none) used those definitions to elaborate in a
      similarly conceptual way about them
    - Instead, it was very common to go to examples to try to discuss
      differences and similarities
    - Examples are good to make a concept more approachable, but they are only
      powerful when such concept is clear and has been discussed in some
      detail before (or after) in the text
    - References
* Specific questions from students and areas they would like me to ellaborate
