## Session on Week 3

#### Reading: Introduction chapter of "*The New Geography of Jobs*", by Enrico Moretti

Questions to discuss about the content of the text:

* Education
* Income segregation linked to educational segregation
* Shift from a secondary to a tertiary economy based on services. Why? What's
  the role of a more productive industry on this?
* Innovation: relevance and larger effects on growth
* The role of Geography in innovation and the economy. The "dead of distance"?
  How does this connect to previous readings in this course?

And methodological aspects:

* Differences in the tone about this text and the one we read by Storper
* How does the author approach the issues he talks about?
* What is the perspective he takes to understand the problems and issues he
  will cover in the book?
* What is his view on the role of Economics and Geography to understand the
  fate of cities/regions?


#### The essay

* Ask about how it went in general
* Main hurdles and things they struggled with
* Aspects they found particularly useful
