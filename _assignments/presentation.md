The second piece of assessment of the semester will be a 10 minute
presentation each student will have to prepare and deliver to the group, followed
by five minutes of questions. Although the topic is open and up to the student
(guided by the tutor), it is recommended to be related and/or based on the
topic of [Essay 3](essay03.html).

More details on the presetation will follow soon.
