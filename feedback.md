# Feedback received from students taking the module

## 2014/15

* Thursdays at noon was a great timing, not too early in the morning (so students would be sleepy), not too late in the day (so theyâ€™d be tired).
* Readings:

	* Excerpt from Jane Jacobs was not received as very exciting.
	* Chapter by Moretti was considered very interesting and a fun read.
	* Chapter from Bettencourt was also hard to read.

* Skills:

	* Referencing properly and searching for literature was found *very* useful by the students and very positively valued.
	* They would suggest adding note taking as a skill to discuss in one of the tutorials as well.

* They all found very positive the experiencing of planning carefully for Essay 3 and suggested it might be good to do similar planning also for Essay 2, even though the question is given at that point.

* All of them found the website a very useful resource. In particular, it was
valued the fact that all the materials were centralized in one place that was
very easy to access and they could go back at any time if they needed to
consult something in particular.
